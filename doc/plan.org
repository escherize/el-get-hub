** Problem: Emacs package managment sucks.
Solution: El-get is the answer
*** why el-get?
Emacs configs are brittle and fragile.
What works on one machine will not just-work on another.
We'll cover using el-get to setup a bulletproof config that is stable,
portable, extensible, and well-documented.
Next we'll cover the recipe-based emacs package archive that I plan to create
for beginners and users who are tired of brittle emacs package installation.
(M)ELPA can break your shit.
Stable MELPA needs people to actually publish to it.

** Problem: There's nowhere to checkout all the cool el-get recipes.
Solution: El-Get Hub, a place to share that stuff.
